        <p>
            I am the proud son of Jody Carrell and Amber Gammons. Currently, I have six siblings split between my mother and father.
            The names of my siblings is Aiden Elliot, Jackson Coffman, Ally Coffman, Essey Carrell, Zeke Carrell, and Izzie Jones.
            My Dad's family loves sports and staying active. All three of my siblings on that side are apart of atleast two sports teams
            that range from baseball to soccer. My Mom's family is more relaxed and likes to spend time wathcing movies and other activities.
            My Dad works as a quality control engineer and my mother is a nurse. I am extremely proud to be apart of both of these families.
