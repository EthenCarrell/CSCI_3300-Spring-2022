            My school life is pretty average I believe. I am working towards a computer science degree while working 
            as a residential hall director for the housing office at APSU to help pay for school. I am doing well in my major, and I am looking 
            to possibly enroll in the master's program here at APSU. All in all, I have really enjoyed my experience at
            APSU. I have made so many friends while I have been here. My friend Jason is the best friend someone could 
            ask for in this world. He and many others are people who I have developed a relationship that will last a 
            lifetime. My experiences at college will push me forward to succeed and to always strive to learn more.
