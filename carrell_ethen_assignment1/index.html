        <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        <p>
           I have held a few hobbies over the course of my life but very few have stuck with me. One of my
           favorite hobbies is reading. I like to consider myself a bibliophile, but I do not have a lot
           of time to read now-a-days. Recently, I am have been trying to learn the piano. I bought a cheap
           keyboard recently, and I am hoping to be a decent player in a few years. I have always liked
           the sound of the piano but never pursued trying to play the instrument. One hobby that I conisder an
           addiction at this point is playing videogames. FPS (First Person Shooter) and RPGS (Role Playing Games)
           are my favorite genre to play with <b>Counter Strike Global Offensive</b> and the <i>Witcher 3</i> being examples of
           games I have enjoyed.

        <h1>School Life</h1>
        <p>
            My school life is pretty busy year round. I work in Housing at Austin Peay State Univeristy as a Residential
            Housing Director over the building Governor's Terrace North. I love my job because I get to work with so
            many wonderful people, but there are some long days and nights at times. I am pursing a degree in Computer
            Science with a concentration in Theory and System. My degree is challenging, but it is worth the hardships it brings.
            I enjoy finding solutions to problems, so I could not think of a better degree to fit me. I have some school friends
            I like to hangout with when I get a chance. Going out to eat is really what I do the most with my friends. Also, I am
            a scholarship worker for the computer science department. This also requires more of my time each week, but I do feel like
            it helps me improve as a student and programmer each semester.
        </p><br>

        <h1>Ambitions</h1>
        <p>
            My dream is to go into artificial intellgence and robotics. I plan to pursue a Master's degree to further my education
            after I graduate this December. I am looking at APSU as my primary choice, and I am hoping to keep climbing towards
            my goal. Outside of what I want for a job in the future, I would really like to travel for a little while before settling
            down to start a family. I am still doing some soul-searching and still trying to find out more about myself.
