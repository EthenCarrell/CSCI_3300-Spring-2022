        <h2>Reading</h2>
        <img sr = "images/reading.jpeg" alt = "This is a picture of a person reading a book">
        <p> I have always enjoyed reading and wished I would be able to do it for pleasure more often. I am 
            a fan of fantasy and mystery novels. I am trying to read more literature to try new things currently.
            Reading was a big part of my childhood and an activity I will always enjoy.

        <p>
            Playing the piano is a relitively new hobby of mine. I just started recently, but I am really happy
            with learning how to play. I have always wanted to play songs on the piano as a kid but never
            pursued learning how to play. Now, I have learned some very easy melodies, and I want to start looking
            for a teacher to learn more.

        <h2>Playing Videogames</h2>
        <img sr = "images/videogames.jpeg" alt = "This is a picture of a person playing a videogame">
        <p>
            I have always enjoyed playing videogames with some of my favorites being <i>Valorant</i>, <i>Witcher 3</i>, and many more.
            I have always enjoyed the FPS and RPG series of games. Also, I can get competitive, but I really enjoy the experience
            of getting to play with friends and others. They have always been a way for me to get away from everything and destress.
            At one point I even wanted to go into game development, but I quickly realized that making games was not for me.
            I don't see myself stopping this hobby anytime soon!
