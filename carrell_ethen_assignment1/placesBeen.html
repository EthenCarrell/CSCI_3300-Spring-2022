            There are only a few notable places that I have been. I have been to both New York City, New York
            and San Francisco, California. When I was in my junior year of high school, my school band traveled to
            New York City to participate in the Saint Patrick's day parade that is held there yearly. It was a long 
            3 mile march when you are a tuba player, but I had a fantastic time! The buildings were so large and liked
            nothing I had ever seen before. The amount of people was also hard to get accustomed to. There was always
            something to do and the sound never stopped. Getting to the top of the Empire State building was 
            probably my favorite part. Seeing everything was so high up was frightening and amazing!

            I went to San Francisco because I was one of the finalist in the Dev Catalyst competition in the State of Tennessee.
            I had made a website that ended up getting me a spot in the prize pool group. The prize was getting to see major 
            companies like Google and Facebook in Silicon Valley. This was one of the coolest experiences of my life. Getting
            to see the west coast for the first time was amazing and all the tech companies blew my mind. Seeing professionals
            work in a large company was eye opening to say the least.
            The Golden Gate Bridge was one of my favorite parts. It is a lot smaller than the movies make it out to be. However, 
            it was still cool to see in person.

            I enjoyed my travels and got to see a lot of new things that I would never see in my hometown. I am hoping to 
            travel more in the future -- maybe even to another continent!
